# Create an array with the following values: 3,5,1,2,7,9,8,13,25,32. Print the sum of all numbers in the array. Also have the function return an array that only include numbers that are greater than 10 (E.g. when you pass the array above, it should return an array with the values of 13,25,32 - hint: use reject or find_all method).
x = [3,5,1,2,7,9,8,13,25,32]
